# History of Node.js && JavaScript

- What is Node.js?
- Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment. It is a popular tool for almost any kind of project!
- Node.js runs the V8 JavaScript engine, the core of Google Chrome, outside of the browser. This allows Node.js to be very performant

- What is JavaScript?
- JavaScript is a text-based programming language used both on the client-side and server-side that allows you to make web pages interactive. Where HTML and CSS are languages that give structure and style to web pages, JavaScript gives web pages interactive elements that engage a user.

- Here one terms comes into picture => that is client-server model => that is "Client-server model is a distributed application structure that partitions tasks or workloads between the providers of a resource or service, called servers, and service requesters, called clients. ... Examples of computer applications that use the client-server model are email, network printing, and the World Wide Web."=> That's why we use backend for creating distributed database for different user.

- in backand, we have access to the os => lot more control => backand is something, we should be very very careful with.
